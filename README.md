# ToDo List Maker

## Overview
**ToDo List Maker** is a simple and efficient task management application that allows users to organize their tasks into three categories:
1. **Things to Do** - Tasks that are yet to be started.
2. **In Progress** - Tasks that are currently being worked on.
3. **Completed** - Tasks that have been finished.

Users can add, update, and delete tasks easily, providing an intuitive way to keep track of their daily tasks.

## Features
- **Add New Tasks**: Users can create new tasks to add to their to-do list.
- **Update Task Status**: Tasks can be moved between the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed" categories.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Organized Interface**: The tasks are organized into separate sections based on their status.
